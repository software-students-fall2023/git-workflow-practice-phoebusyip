### This is my [article.](https://betterprogramming.pub/if-software-engineering-is-in-demand-why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-a-software-engineering-job-c043a964e463)

This article is intriguing to me because it demonstrates the challenges of landing a software engineering job in this current market, and it does this in a humorous perspective. It goes through the automatated coding interview, which the author dislikes the most (for good reason), the coding interview and also the final interview. The author discusses things that most fresh graduate applicants will likely not be aware of, such as the downside of an interview where the applicant gets to pick the language (e.g. the interviewer not knowing the language the applicant picks). One memorable part of this article is how the author describes the HR talk as "They will ask if “now is still a good time.” If it were not a good time, then you probably should not have picked up.", and how they missed one HR talk because they had to unclog a toilet. The article also has links to useful resources for people to prepare for coding interviews, and even included a warm reminder to not blindly use a hashmap for every problem (relatable).

I liked how the article begins by identifying some possible flaws within the process of interviewing for software engineering jobs. Whilst clearly stating that the process may be flawed, it continues to give some advices about the interview, which was helpful and satirical at the same time. I found the 'The initial call with HR' part funny because I could totally relate to the process of 'They will ask you to talk about yourself' to 'They will really try to pitch their company' - and the anecdote about the industry was hilarious!
